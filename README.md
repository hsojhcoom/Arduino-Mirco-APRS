# Arduino-Mirco-APRS

This is a design based on the Mircomodem and LibAPRS (links below).I used the design to create my own boards for a cheaper mobile solution. The different boards are designed around the ATMega 328P uC chip, other chips arduino uses will not work without heavy mods to the libraries.

I will contiune to update the PCB files, with new board designs for different radios.
