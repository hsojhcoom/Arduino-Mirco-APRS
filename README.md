# Arduino-Mirco-APRS

This is a design based on the Mircomodem (https://github.com/markqvist/MicroModem) and LibAPRS(https://github.com/markqvist/LibAPRS).
I used the design to create my own boards for a cheaper mobile solution. I will contiune to update the PCB files, with new board designs
for different radios.
